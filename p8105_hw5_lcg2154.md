## Problem 3

``` r
sim_ttest = function(n,  mu = 0, sigma = 5){
  
  sim_data = tibble(
    x = rnorm(n = 30, mean = mu, sd = sigma),
  )
  
  ttest = t.test(sim_data, mu = 0, sd = 5)
  ttest[['p.value']]
  ttest[['estimate']]
  
  sim_results = tibble(
    pvalue = ttest[['p.value']],
    mean = ttest[['estimate']]
  )
  
}

output = vector("list",100)

#try map
for (i in 1:100) {
  output[[i]] = sim_ttest(30)
}
sim_results = bind_rows(output)
```
